        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>Today’s era is marching towards the rapid growth of all sectors including the 
            agricultural sector. To meet the future food demands, the farmers have to implement 
            the new techniques which will not affect the soil texture but will increase the overall 
            crop production. The aim of this project is to design and develop a solar powered remote 
            controlled fertilizer sprayer machine. The fertilizer sprayer machine is a key component 
            of agricultural field. The various technique used in India for fertilizer sprayer and 
            fertilizer placement are manual, ox and tractor operator. The manual and ox operator 
            technique are time consuming and productivity is low. Tractor is running on fossil fuel 
            which emits carbon dioxide and other pollution every second. This evident has led to 
            widespread air, water and noise pollution and most importantly has led to a realistic 
            energy crisis in the near future, in order to make the development of our farmer as well 
            as nation sustainable and cause less harm to our environment. Nowthe approach of this 
            project is to develop the fertilizer sprayer machine which is to minimize the working 
            cost and the time for digging and fertilizing as well as operate on clean energy. In this 
            machine solar panel is used to capture solar energy and then itis converted into electrical 
            energy which in turn is used to charge 12V battery, which then gives the necessary 
            power to a shunt wound DC motor. This power is then transmitted to the DC motor to 
            drive the wheels. And to further reduction of labor dependency, IR sensors are used to 
            maneuver robot in the field. Here 4 post sensors are used to define the territory and 
            robot senses thetrack length and pitch for movement from line to line. Fertilizer sprayer 
            and digging robot will move different ground contours and performs digging, sow the 
            seed and water the ground after closing.</p>
